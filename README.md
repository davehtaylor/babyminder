# Babyminder

A mobile app that helps parents remember their most precious passengers

According to [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/03/health/hot-car-deaths-child-charts-graphs-trnd/index.html), since 1998, an average of 36 children have died each year in hot cars, with that number peaking at 49 deaths in 2010, with Southern states accounting for more than three quarters of those deaths.

Babyminder uses your phone's accelerometer to detect if you are driving. When it detects that you've reached your destination, Babyminder sends you a push notification, as well as an in-app notification, reminding you to check for your baby.
